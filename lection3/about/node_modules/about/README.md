## Usage

If you don't have your profile set up yet, fork this project, add yours in `./src/profiles/` and submit a pull request!

If you have already published your profile, just ask your friends to install Node.js and run:

```bash
$ npx about Your Name Here
```

## Built with

- [`ink`](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) - React for interactive command-line apps
- [`terminal-image`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/terminal-image) - Display images in the terminal

## About the Profile Creating Process

Right now all profile creation and changes are submitted as PRs and are reviewed manually, but eventually I'll set up a web app and move all the profiles to a database.

I'll try my best, however, I cannot guarantee to be always available for reviewing the changes.

## Thanks

This project is inspired by [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)'s [Sindre Sorhus CLI](https://github.com/sindresorhus/sindresorhus), and wouldn't be possible without the Ink library from [Vadim Demedes](https://github.com/vadimdemedes) and Sindre.
